Microsoft ToDo is a really nice tool but is missing a few key features. For me, something I really needed was to be able to see what I had worked on yesterday so that I could report it during my morning standup meetings.

Deployed to https://todo.report.

# Build the project
Built with create-react-app so all the usual stuff applies. 

`npm install`
`npm start`

navigate to http://localhost:3000.
